n denotes number of features
m denotes the number of examples
********************************************************************************

Gradient Descent: performs well when number of features is high (> 10,000)
Normal Equation: performs well when number of features is low (< 1000)

Gradient Descent: Need to choose alpha, and that requires iterations
Normal Method: No need to choose alpha
